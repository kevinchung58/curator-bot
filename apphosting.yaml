runConfig:
  # The number of CPU cores to allocate to each instance.
  # Default is 1. Fractional CPUs are not supported.
  # For Gen 2 Cloud Functions (which App Hosting uses), common values are 1, 2, 4.
  cpu: 1
  # The amount of memory in MiB to allocate to each instance.
  # Default is 512. Max is 32768 (32 GiB).
  memoryMiB: 512
  # The maximum number of instances that can be spun up.
  # Increase this value if you'd like to automatically spin up
  # more instances in response to increased traffic.
  maxInstances: 1
  # The minimum number of instances to keep running.
  # Set to 0 to allow scaling to zero for cost savings during idle periods.
  # If you implement an auto-monitoring agent that needs to run continuously
  # or frequently, you might consider setting this to 1.
  minInstances: 0
  # Concurrency refers to the number of requests an instance can handle at the same time.
  # Default is 80. Max is 1000.
  # concurrency: 80
  # Timeout for requests, in seconds.
  # Default is 60s. Max is 3600s (1 hour).
  # timeoutSeconds: 60

# buildSettings:
  # Optional: Specify a custom build command.
  # By default, App Hosting will try to detect and run the appropriate build command.
  # buildCommand: "npm run build"
  # Optional: Specify the version of Node.js to use.
  # nodeVersion: "20" # Or your desired LTS version

# Environment variables can also be set here, but it's often preferred
# to set them via the Firebase console or gcloud for sensitive values.
# env:
#   - variable: MY_ENV_VAR
#     value: "my_value"
#   - variable: ANOTHER_VAR
#     value: "another_value"
