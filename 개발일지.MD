# Development Log (Content Curator Bot)

## üöÄ Key Feature Status

- **Strategy Formulation**: When a user inputs a curriculum/topic, the AI suggests relevant search keywords, target websites, and content types to monitor. (Basic implementation complete)
- **Content Discovery & Processing**: When a user adds a URL, the content is summarized, and tags are generated. (Basic implementation complete, uses local storage)
- **Settings**: API keys (OpenRouter, Google AI), LINE channel information, GitHub information, default curation topic, etc., can be configured. (UI implemented, actual saving is simulated and uses browser localStorage)
- **Send to LINE**: There's a button to send processed content to LINE, but the actual API integration is a placeholder.

## üìù TODO List (English)

### Core Feature Improvements & Implementation

- **[ ] Implement Actual Settings Storage**:
    - Change settings currently temporarily stored in `localStorage` and simulated in server actions to be saved in an actual database or secure server-side storage (e.g., Firebase Firestore, environment variables, Secret Manager).
    - Ensure sensitive information like API keys is managed securely on the server-side.
- **[ ] Implement Actual LINE Bot Integration**:
    - Implement the actual LINE Messaging API integration logic in the `sendToLineAction` function in `src/lib/actions.ts`.
    - Detail the message format and success/failure handling for transmissions.
- **[ ] Develop Content Auto-Monitoring Agent**:
    - As mentioned in `DiscoveredContentSection`, currently, only manual URL input is possible.
    - Develop an agent that periodically or based on specific triggers monitors designated websites/keywords on the backend and automatically discovers new content to add to `DiscoveredContentSection`.
- **[ ] Detail GitHub Integration Feature**:
    - Although GitHub PAT and repository URL fields exist in settings, they are not actually used.
    - Implement a feature to convert curated content into Markdown files (or similar) and automatically publish (commit/push) them to the specified GitHub repository.
- **[ ] Content Versioning or History**:
    - (Optional) Consider a feature to track changes or publication history of processed content.

### AI and Genkit Flow Enhancements

- **[ ] Enhance AI Prompts**:
    - Continuously test and improve the prompts for `formulateSearchStrategy` and `generateContentSummary` flows to enhance the quality of the results.
    - Ensure the AI's response stability for various inputs.
- **[ ] Review Genkit Tool Usage**:
    - Current AI flows are primarily prompt-based. Consider using Genkit Tools for external API calls or complex data retrieval to increase the flexibility and scalability of the flows (e.g., a Tool to directly fetch website content).
- **[ ] Image Generation/Processing Feature (if needed)**:
    - If content includes images, consider using Genkit to generate relevant images or process existing ones.
    - Adhere to `next/image` component and `data-ai-hint` guidelines.

### UI/UX Improvements

- **[ ] Detailed Loading State Indication**:
    - Provide UI/UX that indicates progress beyond a simple spinner when AI flows are executing (strategy formulation, content processing). (e.g., step-by-step progress display)
- **[ ] Strengthen User Feedback**:
    - Provide clear and useful feedback for task success, failure, warnings, etc. (Utilize `useToast`)
- **[ ] Improve Input Validation Messages**:
    - Make validation failure messages more user-friendly for form inputs.
- **[ ] Review Responsive Design and Accessibility (A11y)**:
    - Check layouts on various screen sizes and continuously improve web accessibility using ARIA attributes, etc.

### Technical Debt & Code Quality

- **[ ] Overall Error Handling Enhancement**:
    - Strengthen exception handling for unexpected errors across client components, server actions, and AI flows, and provide appropriate guidance to users.
- **[ ] Write Test Code**:
    - Write unit and integration tests for key components, server actions, and AI flows.
    - Define and automate E2E test scenarios.
- **[ ] Code Refactoring**:
    - Conduct ongoing code refactoring, including removing duplicate code, separating components, and improving readability.
- **[ ] Dependency Management**:
    - Regularly check and update library versions in `package.json`.

### Deployment & Operations

- **[ ] Detail `apphosting.yaml` Configuration**:
    - Review and optimize resource settings (number of instances, memory, etc.) for the production environment.
- **[ ] Environment Variable Management**:
    - Establish a plan for securely managing API keys and settings for development, staging, and production environments (e.g., `.env` files, Firebase environment configuration).
- **[ ] Logging and Monitoring**:
    - Add logging for server actions and AI flow execution to improve traceability in case of issues.
